# [ADDON] SmartTooltip - Take Full Control of Your Tooltip Positioning

Hey everyone! I'm excited to share **SmartTooltip**, a lightweight addon I've been working on that gives you complete control over where your tooltips appear.

## What It Does

Ever had a tooltip block your action bars, buffs, or important raid frames? SmartTooltip solves this by letting you position tooltips exactly where you want them - with pixel-perfect precision.

## Key Features

🎯 **9 Anchor Points** - Attach tooltips to any position relative to your cursor (top, bottom, left, right, center, corners)

⚙️ **Adjustable Offsets** - Fine-tune positioning from -100 to +100 pixels in both directions

🖼️ **Live Preview** - Interactive test area shows exactly how your tooltips will look

🌍 **Fully Localized** - Currently supports English and Portuguese Brazilian (more coming!)

💾 **Persistent Settings** - Everything saves automatically

## Why I Made This

I rebuilt this from a simple tooltip follower into a full-featured positioning tool because I was tired of tooltips getting in the way during raids. I wanted something lightweight that "just works" without impacting performance.

## How to Use

1. Install from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/smarttooltip)
2. Type `/st config` or go to ESC → Interface → AddOns → SmartTooltip
3. Pick your anchor point and adjust the offsets
4. Hover over the test area to preview
5. Done!

## Technical Stuff

- **Zero performance impact** - only runs when tooltips show
- **Lightweight** - under 100 KB
- **Compatible** with ElvUI, TipTac, and most UI mods
- **Built with AceLocale-3.0** for easy community translations
